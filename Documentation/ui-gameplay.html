&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a screen shot of both the drum and guitar modes activated at
game time.  You will notice that the notes scroll down for drums and up for guitars.  This was 
designed for those familiar with other popular games similar to DigiBand, and will in a future
release of DigiBand will have options for scrolling up or down.  Here you will be actively playing
the music as it is displayed.  When a note passes the timing bar, you must be pressing the
appropriate instrument key at this time. (more about this in "how to play") The video display
plays the video for the song, certain themes will have animations in the background.  Notes and
measure bars will scroll on the screen evenly.  If you miss any notes or play them poorly, the 
lifebar will decrease.  If the life bar decreases to zero you will see this:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously this is not desireable.  Seeing this is generally humiliating... but if you feel
uncomfortable with playing DigiBand, it is recommended to practice.  As some professionals have
mentioned it's best to here the song before playing it.  When you are in the song selection screen
you can play the music to preview it and hear it first by pressing F6.  If you still feel uncomfortable with a song
you could try going to the options menu, and turning arcade style failing off. But don't be 
discouraged yet!   Since this game as well as many popular rhythm games are based on timing, hitting
a note more accurately will reward you with a combo bonus and more lifebar.  More on this in "how
to play."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When playing solo, you shold immediately notice that the video window
is bigger.  You will want to make sure of this, because when playing with others the life meter is 
shared!  Once all three players reach zero life, the game will end.  Here are screen shots of what
your screen should look like while playing solo:<br>
