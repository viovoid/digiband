1. Double click the archive you have downloaded (Usually .zip).<br>
2. Navigate to your installation of DigiBand<br>
3. Open the songs directory.<br>
4. The song will need to be installed in this pattern: DigiBand\Songs\&lt;category&gt;\&lt;song name&gt;\(bas.dtx adv.dtx ext.dtx bas.gda adv.gda ext.gda), 
Usually this is already prepared for you within the archive.<br>
5.  Check to make sure the archive has a "category" then extract it to the songs Directory if there is a category, or create a category directory
and extract the song there if no category was found.
