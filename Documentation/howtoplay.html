&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're going to start assuming you already know how to activate each instrument as discussed earlier in this manual.
After you choose your song you should see the game play screen like the one above.  You should notice that each <i>instrument</i> is devided up into 
tracks. each <i>note</i> follows that track moving along with the <i>measure bars</i>.  Hitting <i>notes</i> poorly or missing them will take away your life.
While hitting <i>notes</i> accurately will raise your life, but not by much.  Below will describe what you need to do with each <i>note</i>.<br><br>
<b> How to play the drums</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the note reaches the <i>timing bar</i> you must be prepared to hit the corresponding drum with your drum stick, or 
press the corresponding key or button.  You will notice that at times you may have to hit some <i>notes</i> multiple times in row, this is a drum roll.
Drum rolls require to speed up your pace, then resume the pace you were taking before. Alot of times you will have to hit two <i>notes</i> at once, this
will require use of both hands hitting each drum at the same time.  You will also notice the 3rd <i>instrument</i> is a bass pedal, you will need to use 
either your left or right foot, depending on your setup to hit this pedal in cordination with your hands. If you are using a keyboard, it is recommended 
to lay out each <i>instrument</i> in a row.  By default the <i>instruments</i> are z,x,c,v,b, and n.  The names of these <i>instruments</i> are hihat,
snare, bass, hitom, lotom, and cymbal.
<br><br>
<b> How to play the gutiar</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guitar requires you to hit each <i>note</i> similar to the drums.  you will want to wait until your <i>note</i>
reaches your <i>timing bar</i> before hitting the <i>note</i>.  The trick with the guitar is that it requires two motions instead of one.  Just pressing the
corresponding <i>intrument</i>, known as a fret for guitars, will not work.  You will need to think ahead.  The proper way to play, would be to hold the <i>instrument</i>/fret
down, before the <i>note</i> reaches your <i>timing bar</i>.  When the <i>note</i> reaches the timing bar, you will then need to strum your pick,
strumming either up or down.  At times you will see a long purple bar over all three <i>notes</i>. You will need to release all <i>instruments</i>/frets
before strumming your pick on this <i>note</i>. This type of note is called an open pick <i>note</i>. Similar to the drums, you may also be required to hold
2 or even all 3 frets down before strumming your pick. The guitar also has a 'wailing' bonus.  A note that doesn't count for or against you, just simply
adds some points to your score for doing.  You will see a guitar pointed neck up on the right of your notes.  This is when you will want to do the same with
your guitar. If wailing is assigned to a button or key you will want to be holding this key down to acheive this.<br>

<b> Tips</b><br>
-Practice! It's the most important part, DigiBand takes alot of getting used to. <br>
-Use the F6 option in the song selection screen to hear the song first before playing it.  This is great for practice, so you can get an idea of when you 
will be hitting a note.<br>
-Speed modifications.  It may seem like the notes are moving to fast or to slow for you.  You can adjust this speed in either the options screen, or the 
song selection screen.<br>
-Relax!  Don't let the game cause you to panic.  Panicking will generally cause you to error more, you will need to let go of any inhibition you may have.
It's sometimes best to play alone, but when playing with others, just relax and don't think about what others are thinking.<br>
-Variety!  Don't just stick to a song because it's easy, find a song that you like, like to hear, like the video of, etc.  Then aspire to play that song.
Besides that's what this game's about, the music.  Once you've found something you like, keep trying at it, so you can one day play it well say... with your
friends!<br>
-Be comfortable! If you are playing with recommended instruments (drum pads and guitars), make sure your setup is comfortable.  Try to put your self in a 
position in front of your drums so you are not extending your reach to far.  If your guitar has a strap, make sure it holds the base in position you 
feel confortable strumming in.
