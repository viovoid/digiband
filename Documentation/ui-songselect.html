&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first this system may seem overwhelming, but with time you will 
come to understand the system and use these tools and options to become a better player.  If you 
are a beginner try to stay below 20% difficulty or 2* until you feel confident to handle faster
and more complicated songs.<br>
