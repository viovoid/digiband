&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here you will be presented with the details for this stage.  The grade is much similar to what you would get in school,
A-D based on a percentage of greats and perfects. F for failing the song.  S, SS and SSS for a percentage of Perfects over greats.  It is possible to
move on to the next song and still receive an F grade.  Game score is the over score for this stage and all concurrent stages.  Bonus points are obtained
each round based on your max combo.  A full combo will give you even more bonus points.  The score on the bottom is the overall score for this stage.
